### Hi there 👋
- I'm HaiYenNg. I have learned more from my failures than from my success. Mistakes are the portals of discovery. I may not be there yet, but I’m closer than I was yesterday
- 💞️ “My great concern is not whether you have failed, but whether you are content with your failure.”
- 📫 “Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up”.

## About me
✨ Welcome everyone to Hai Yen's git, I didn't have enough preparation and experience to enter this game, but what I have is that once I do it. 
I will devote myself to it so that it achieves the best results.
I believe that one day soon, I will conquer it with everyone's lovely support. ✨ 

🌱 I’m currently learning knowledge about **Node Js, JPA with Hibernate and more...**...
